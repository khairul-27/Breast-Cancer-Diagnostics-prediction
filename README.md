# Machine Learning Based Comparative Analysis for Breast Cancer Prediction
 One of the primary reasons of rising death rates among women worldwide is breast cancer. Radiologists find it challenging to make an accurate diagnosis of breast cancer due to the complicated nature of the disease's cells (microcalcification and tumors).It is essential to enhance the current diagnostic systems due to the inherent hazards involved with a delayed and/or inaccurate diagnosis. In this regard, machine learning has increasingly shown promise for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer.The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset has been used for this task, and as a working prototype, it has been classified using a hybrid Multilayer Perceptron Model (MLP) and 5-fold cross-validation framework. A connection-based feature selection method has been employed for the better classification, which also eliminatesÂ the recursive features.This repository introduces a new machine learning-based framework that effectively predicts breast cancer from patient data using the Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Multilayer Perception techniques.
